# lsp
A lightweight LSP Compositor Written Mainly to Solve Typescript issues once and for all.


LSP is a basic Composition Based Component Runner Written as Marketplace Addon and Extension this concept is used all over in the stealify and unlicense-code projects. The Pattern is highly effective.

This runs a Server that is Controlable via a CLI This allows you to define Tasks that should happen. This Registers in the Extension Manifests the needed Capabilitys and Permissions if needed so that the Composit receives events from its embedder.

The Composit is able to run workers and pass its own capabilitys into them to get modifyed by the worker.

That allows to Reconfigure the LSP Implementation as needed. On The Fly.
